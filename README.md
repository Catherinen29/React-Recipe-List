# React List

## Introduction

This was my second project on General Assembly's SEI course. The task was to create a webpage on which the user can:
- Add a new item to a list
- Mark the item as complete/favorite/(watch, read, listen) later/flag/etc
- Edit an item from a list
- Remove an item from a list
- Clear/delete all items
- Clear/delete only marked items

The webpage needed to include multiple pages using React Router and fetch data from an API.
